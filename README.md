# THIS DOES NOT WORK YET

Parse output spectra (frequency-dependent permittivities) for IPA/RPA calculations in YAMBO.
Theoretically, it should work for TDDFT as well, but it does not read in infos about the Kernel.
Only groundstate info from QuantumEspresso (QE) is supported right now.
If e.g. ABINIT was used or QE files are not there, the parser will still parse the spectra,
but not parse any groundstate data.

As the QE parser is not updated yet, this parser uses a workaround to get the groundstate
properties, which only really works for the way our group has defined the files.
Once the QE parser is fully working, one should separate this out into a workflow.

# nomad-parser-yambospectra

Nomad example template

This `nomad` plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter` along with `@nomad`'s [`cookiecutter-nomad-plugin`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/cookiecutter-nomad-plugin) template.


## Development

If you want to develop locally this plugin, clone the project and in the plugin folder, create a virtual environment (you can use Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/magr4826/nomad-parser-yambospectra.git
cd nomad-parser-yambospectra
python3.11 -m venv .pyenv
. .pyenv/bin/activate
```

Make sure to have `pip` upgraded:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

We recommend installing `uv` for fast pip installation of the packages:
```sh
pip install uv
```

Install the `nomad-lab` package:
```sh
uv pip install '.[dev]' --index-url https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/api/v4/projects/2187/packages/pypi/simple
```

**Note!**
Until we have an official pypi NOMAD release with the plugins functionality make
sure to include NOMAD's internal package registry (via `--index-url` in the above command).

The plugin is still under development. If you would like to contribute, install the package in editable mode (with the added `-e` flag):
```sh
uv pip install -e '.[dev]' --index-url https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/api/v4/projects/2187/packages/pypi/simple
```


### Run the tests

You can run locally the tests:
```sh
python -m pytest -sv tests
```

where the `-s` and `-v` options toggle the output verbosity.

Our CI/CD pipeline produces a more comprehensive test report using the `pytest-cov` package. You can generate a local coverage report:
```sh
uv pip install pytest-cov
python -m pytest --cov=src tests
```

### Run linting and auto-formatting

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting the code. Ruff auto-formatting is also a part of the GitHub workflow actions. You can run locally:
```sh
ruff check .
ruff format . --check
```


### Debugging

For interactive debugging of the tests, use `pytest` with the `--pdb` flag. We recommend using an IDE for debugging, e.g., _VSCode_. If that is the case, add the following snippet to your `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "<descriptive tag>",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "launch",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/.pyenv/bin/pytest",
        "justMyCode": true,
        "env": {
            "_PYTEST_RAISE": "1"
        },
        "args": [
            "-sv",
            "--pdb",
            "<path-to-plugin-tests>",
        ]
    }
  ]
}
```

where `<path-to-plugin-tests>` must be changed to the local path to the test module to be debugged.

The settings configuration file `.vscode/settings.json` automatically applies the linting and formatting upon saving the modified file.


### Documentation on Github pages

To view the documentation locally, install the related packages using:
```sh
uv pip install -r requirements_docs.txt
```

Run the documentation server:
```sh
mkdocs serve
```


## Adding this plugin to NOMAD

Currently, NOMAD has two distinct flavors that are relevant depending on your role as an user:
1. [A NOMAD Oasis](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-nomad-oasis): any user with a NOMAD Oasis instance.
2. [Local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-local-nomad-installation-and-the-source-code-of-nomad): internal developers.

### Adding this plugin in your NOMAD Oasis

Read the [NOMAD plugin documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html) for all details on how to deploy the plugin on your NOMAD instance.

### Adding this plugin in your local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD

Modify the text file under `/nomad/default_plugins.txt` and add:
```sh
<other-content-in-default_plugins.txt>
nomad-parser-yambospectra==x.y.z
```
where `x.y.z` represents the released version of this plugin.

Then, go to your NOMAD folder, activate your NOMAD virtual environment and run:
```sh
deactivate
cd <route-to-NOMAD-folder>/nomad
source .pyenv/bin/activate
./scripts/setup_dev_env.sh
```

Alternatively and only valid for your local NOMAD installation, you can modify `nomad.yaml` to include this plugin, see [NOMAD Oasis - Install plugins](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html).


### Build the python package

The `pyproject.toml` file contains everything that is necessary to turn the project
into a pip installable python package. Run the python build tool to create a package distribution:

```sh
pip install build
python -m build --sdist
```

You can install the package with pip:

```sh
pip install dist/nomad-parser-yambospectra-0.1.0
```

Read more about python packages, `pyproject.toml`, and how to upload packages to PyPI
on the [PyPI documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).


### Template update

We use cruft to update the project based on template changes. A `cruft-update.yml` is included in Github workflows to automatically check for updates and create pull requests to apply updates. Follow the [instructions](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-03-github-actions-prevent-github-actions-from-creating-and-approving-pull-requests/) on how to enable Github Actions to create pull requests.

To run the check for updates locally, follow the instructions on [`cruft` website](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#updating-a-project).
